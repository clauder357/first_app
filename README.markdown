His is where I found out about the gem I installed.# Welcome to my first_app

   
This is  the firts app I work on, from the [*Ruby on rails  Tutorial: Learn Rails by example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
One funny thing tough, in the tutorial it does not say yu need to have the redcarpet gem installed locally so that github can locate the README.markdown file.

Before I installed it, Github was complaining it could not locate  the README file, and it was displaying a link to supported markdown languages.
